    <string name="description_conversation">The Conversation mode is the main feature of OneVoice, it allows you to translate a conversation between several people in real time, for a better experience it is recommended to connect bluetooth headphones to the phone,
        furthermore the application will continue to work also in background and with the phone on standby (however, some phones may have performance issues when the app runs in the background)</string>
    <string name="description_walkie_talkie">WalkieTalkie mode is the secondary functionality of OneVoice, it does not allow real-time translation but is designed to work with just one phone,
        it automatically detects and translates a speech in a language into another language, and the application will continue to work in background and with the phone on standby</string>
    <string name="description_notice">OneVoice uses <a href="https://openai.com/index/whisper/">OpenAi\'s Whisper</a> for speech recognition and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/no-language-left-behind/">Meta\'s NLLB</a> for translations, these models require quite a bit of power and at least 6GB of RAM to run, so make sure you\'re using a modern smartphone to avoid slowdowns or crashes.
